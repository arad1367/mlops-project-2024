# Student Performance Indicators MLOps Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline to predict student performance indicators using MLOps practices. The pipeline involves data ingestion, data transformation, and model training stages. Additionally, a Flask web application is provided to interact with the model and display results. The project structure follows best practices for MLOps, ensuring modularity, reproducibility, and scalability. The project deployed on AWS and Azure clouds.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/arad1367/mlops-project-2024.git`
`cd mlops-project-2024`

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
`python -m venv venv`
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the setup script:
`python setup.py` --> Just once to make package

## Running the Application
1. Start the Flask web application:
`python application.py`

2. Open your web browser and go to local address to access the application.

## Project Components
- Data Ingestion
The data_ingestion.py script is responsible for collecting data from various sources. It includes functionalities to handle different data formats and ensures data is properly loaded into the pipeline.

- Data Transformation
The data_transformation.py script handles preprocessing and transforming the ingested data. It includes steps for data cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling, preparing the data for model training.

- Model Training
The model_trainer.py script is responsible for training machine learning models. It includes functionalities for model selection, training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

- Pipeline Utilities
The pipeline/ folder contains essential utility scripts:

* exception.py: Defines custom exceptions for better error handling.
* logger.py: Configures logging to track the pipeline's execution.
* utils.py: Provides helper functions used across different components.

- Logging and Exception Handling
The project includes comprehensive logging and exception handling mechanisms to ensure smooth execution and easy debugging. Logs provide insights into the pipeline's status, and exceptions are handled gracefully to prevent crashes.

- Artifacts
The artifacts/ folder stores all the output data and models generated by the pipeline. This ensures that results are organized and easily accessible for analysis and deployment.

- Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and includes relevant tests.
